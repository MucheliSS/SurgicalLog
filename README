# SurgicalLog

This project provides a Streamlit app for logging surgical cases and reviewing them in a dashboard.

## Running locally

1. Create and activate a Python environment.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas
   ```
3. Start the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. Open the URL shown in the terminal to interact with the logbook.

Log data is stored in **`surgical_log.csv`** in the project directory. The CSV file is not version-controlled and will be recreated if missing.

## Deploying on Streamlit Cloud

1. Push this repository to GitHub or another supported source control provider.
2. Sign in to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and create a new app, selecting your repository and `app.py` as the entry point.
3. Once deployed, the app runs in the cloud. The default setup stores entries in `surgical_log.csv` within the ephemeral container.

For production deployments where data must persist or be shared across users, connect the app to a persistent backend (e.g., a database or cloud storage) instead of relying solely on the CSV file.
